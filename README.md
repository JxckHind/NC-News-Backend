# Northcoders Backend Project - NC News API

## How to access the databases:

In order to connect to the two databases involved in this project on your local machine you must first create the environment variables yourself.

You will need to create two .env files, once named '.env.test' and another '.env.development'.

In the '.env.test' file you should add the following code: 'PGDATABASE=nc_news_test'. In the '.env.development' file you should add: 'PGDATABASE=nc_news'.

You should now be able to access the two databases and run the preoject on your local machine.
